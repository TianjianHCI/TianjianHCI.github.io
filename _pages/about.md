Hi, this is Tianjian. I am currently a PhD student at [ArkLab, HKUST(GZ)](https://arkxlab.github.io/), where I am supervised by [Prof. Xin Tong](https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/people/tong-xin/). My research focuses on human-computer interaction (HCI), with an emphasis on developing systems that enhance **synchronous collaboration** between humans and language models. To achieve this goal, I concentrate on model **proactivity, personalization, and guidance** in human-AI collaboration. Additionally, I am interested in **empirical research** in HCI and AI, such as understanding people in HCI and evaluation in AI.

Previously, I received the bacholar degree in Sun Yat-sen University, where I am supervised by [Prof. Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan) in LLMs and [Prof. Zhenhui Peng](https://zhenhuipeng.com/) in HCI.

# Life
I maintain a [Chinese Blog](https://liutj9.github.io/) for research reflections or informal notes.

I am fan of ACGN (Animations, Comics, Games, and Novels). Some awesome works are not only a source of joy and relaxation, but may also bring some encouragement for my research :). I am also dedicated to observing, using and building AI tools or communities related to the ACGN.

These following works have deeply moved and encouraged me:

- [Revue Starlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revue_Starlight)
- [Sound! Euphonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound!_Euphonium)
- [A Place Further Than The Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_Further_than_the_Universe)
- [SHIROBAKO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirobako)
